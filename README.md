# DiffuWaste
The master's thesis focused on Data Augmentation, using Diffusion Models, to address data scarcity issues in semantic segmentation tasks, within the Robotic Waste Sorting System (RoWSS) domain.
- The goal was to generate synthetic photorealistic images to train a semantic segmentation model, improving its performance by up to 4% for the entire dataset.
- The most encouraging result was achieved using only a small portion (10\%) of the entire dataset, achieving accuracy comparable to the one obtained with the entire dataset.
